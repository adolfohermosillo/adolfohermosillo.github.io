## About me
Hi! I am Adolfo, a third-year PhD student in the Department of Linguistics at Stanford advised by [Christopher Potts](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/). I am broadly interested in natural language processing, semantics, sociolinguistics and multilingualism. I use computational and experimental methods to answer questions about meaning and variation. I am a member of [The Stanford NLP Group](https://nlp.stanford.edu/) and [ALPS](https://alpslab.stanford.edu/).
